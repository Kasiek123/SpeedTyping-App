<h1>SpeedTyping-App</h1> 

<p align="justify">The Speed Tping Application is a simple Python program that helps users improve their typing speed and accuracy. It presents the users with a random sentence sourced from a file and assesses their typing accuracy and speed as they type the sentence.</p>
